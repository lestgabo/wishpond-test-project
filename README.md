ISSUES:   

    - annoyingly got stuck at root so my terminal was not colorful      
    
        - my terminal looked like this ubuntu@beeftosino-wishpond-test-project3-6167128:~/workspace/wishpond-test-project$    
          
        - fixed by entering: sudo -su ubuntu   
            
    - set page1 to home  
        
    - trying multiple upload from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21411988/rails-4-multiple-image-or-file-upload-using-carrierwave
